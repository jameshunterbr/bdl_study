## Purpose

This file will test the determination of bias and variance when calculating viral loads and other variables that are subject to detection limits. For HIV-1 patients, the objective of antiretroviral treatment is to make their plasma RNA viral load zero.

However, there is a practical limit below which the assays cannot distinguish between the presence of virus and having no virus (the zero objective). This is called the "detection limit" and patients who achieve this level are said to have a viral load "BDL", below detection limit. One of the most important consequences of exactitude in measuring true lack of the presence of virus is the phrase "undetectable = untransmittable" [@chang2025][@combescure2009]. This frees, at least emotionally, the individual from concern about transmitting the virus to a partner.

There have been various strategies to deal with calculations of viral load in a panel of patients. One has been to eliminate the cases from the calculation, another has been to treat the viral level of those patients who are BDL as 0, assuming they are really without any virus. Still another strategy has been to assign a value equal to the detection limit. Others have used a value of half the detection limit, i.e., half of the difference between the detection limit and zero.

| Name   | Strategy                         | Value Assigned to "BDL" |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| censor | eliminate case                   | no value                |
| zero   | treat as zero                    | 0                       |
| dl     | treat as detection limit         | detection limit         |
| halfdl | treat as half of detection limit | detection limit/2       |

This study was inspired by a blog post by Nikolas Siccha, "Lower Limits of Detection or Quantification".[@siccha2025] He develops a Bayesian model to explore the pharmacodynamics of drugs that cause the measurement of interest to fall below detection limits. As it deals with the dynamics over time of a drug's presence and efficacy in a patient, his question is more complex than the question I would like to address here.

::: callout-important
What is the relationship between the true value of viral load below detection limit and the strategies used to estimate it and how does that effect analyses of the viral load of a sample or population?

## Method

I will create a panel of 1,000 PLWH artificially with estimates of their viral load at a baseline and after 6 simulated months of antiretroviral treatment (ART).
